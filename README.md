# odin-recipes
1st Odin project task

Creating a simple TOP website for recipes; should look pretty bare-bones at the start, but doing it step by step.

First version consists of the three recipes pages, small amounts of styling and positioning.
Later versions would include more styling and usage of flexbox, proper navigation, UI elements etc.

Currently done iterations: all four, project ready for submission.
